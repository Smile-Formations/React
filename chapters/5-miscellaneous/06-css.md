## `CSS`

<Toc maxDepth="2" mode="onlySiblings"/>

### Processed alternatives

You can manage `CSS` as we did, by importing CSS files directly.

But since v2, `create-react-app` also natively supports:

* `CSS modules`
* `SASS` and `SCSS`

---

### `CSS-in-JS`

Or you can use CSS-in-JS with inline styles or with more advanced plugins like:

* `styled-components`
* `Aphrodite`
* `Emotion`
* `Glamorous`
* `JSS`
* `Radium`
* ...
